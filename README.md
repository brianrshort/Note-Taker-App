# Note-Taker-App

This note-taking app allows users to log, display, and delete notes. 

To complete this project, I used Express to create the server, separate files for routing APIs and HTML files, AJAX to get/post/delete API JSON objects, package.json, as well as javascript and dynamically generated HTML.

Here's a gif of how the app works:
