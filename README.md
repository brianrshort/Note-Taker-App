# Note Taker App

This note-taking app allows users to log, display, and delete notes via a web interface.

# Motivation

This project was completed as part of the Michigan State University/Trilogy Web Development Bootcamp program. The goal of this project was to work with using front-end methods to grab information and translate it into API JSON objects. 

# Screenshot

Here's a gif of how the app works:

# Tech

To complete this project, I used Express to create the server, used separate files for routing APIs and HTML files, utilized AJAX to get/post/delete API JSON objects, created package.json, as well as building JavaScript to dynamically generated HTML.
